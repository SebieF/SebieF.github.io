## Outline of this blog

I have never been the one to talk much about myself. I have, however, been in love with science as long as I can
remember. Science is in its foundations a very idealistic thing to pursue. Learning new things, investigating
undisclosed areas that are beyond our current knowledge, expanding your own skill sets to be able to solve practical
problems - all of this is just great! But not everyone is playing fair in this game,
because there are major players in our field that seek to increase and manifest their power.

That is why I want to start writing about my own journey towards *Open Science Research*, learn about its principles,
publish my learnings and also discuss the relation between society and (my personal) research. All of this in order
to foster science and the scientific method - one of the best ways we created to think about our world.
